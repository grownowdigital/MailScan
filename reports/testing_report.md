## 4. Key Security Invariants Verified

- **Authoritative Data Source:** Exclusively loads from `dataset/testing/`. Rejects root ML training directory as test source.
- **Zero Fallback Invariant:** Throws explicit hard error if test folder is empty or absent (never falls back to demo/mock data).
- **Zero-Evidence Safety Rule:** Benign emails receive low Threat Risk (<=15/100) and cannot arbitrarily be escalated.
- **Microsoft FP Benchmark:** Authentic Microsoft tenant notifications pass with 5/100 Threat Risk and `Legitimate` verdict.
- **Determinism:** 100% identical outputs across 3 consecutive pipeline iterations.
- **Static Sandboxing:** Zero execution of embedded JavaScript, form actions, or macros during inspection.
